        <li>1/4 cup margarine</li>
        <li>1/4 cup milk</li>
        <li>1/4 cup warm water</li>
        <li>3 cups all purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 1/4 teaspoon active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons anise seed</li>
        <li>1/4 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>2 eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons orange zest</li>
        <li>1/4 cup orange juice</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon orange zest</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Step 1</strong>Heat the milk and the butter together in a medium saucepan, until the butter melts. Remove from the heat and add them warm water. The mixture should be around 110 degrees F (43 degrees C).</li>
        <li><strong>Step 2</strong>In a large bowl combine 1 cup of the flour, yeast, salt, anise seed and 1/4 cup of the sugar. Beat in the warm milk mixture then add the eggs and orange zest and beat until well combined. Stir in 1/2 cup of flour and continue adding more flour until the dough is soft.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 3</strong>Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 4</strong>Place the dough into a lightly greased bowl cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size. This will take about 1 to 2 hours. Punch the dough down and shape it into a large round loaf with a round knob on top. Place dough onto a baking sheet, loosely cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place for about 1 hour or until just about doubled in size.</li>
        <li><Strong>Step 5</Strong>Bake in a preheated 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) oven for about 35 to 45 minutes. Remove from oven let cool slightly then brush with glaze.</li>
        <li><Strong>Step 6</Strong>To make glaze: In a small saucepan combine the 1/4 cup sugar, orange juice and orange zest. Bring to a boil over medium heat and boil for 2 minutes. Brush over top of bread while still warm. Sprinkle glazed bread with white sugar.</li>
    </ul>
